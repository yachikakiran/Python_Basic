    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "ans. Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime, without needing a separate compilation step. Examples: Python, JavaScript.\n",
    "Compiled languages convert the entire code into machine code before execution, improving performance. Examples: C, C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "ans. It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, except, finally, and else blocks to prevent program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "ans. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs, typically used for cleanup operations like \n",
    "closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
    "ans. The logging module provides a way to track events in a program, useful for debugging, monitoring, and error tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "ans. It is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, used to free resources like file handles or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "ans. import module imports the entire module, requiring module.function().\n",
    "from module import function imports specific functions or variables, allowing direct use without module prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "ans. Use multiple except blocks for different exceptions or use except (Exception1, Exception2) as e: to handle multiple exceptions in one block.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "ans. It ensures proper file closure after use, even if an exception occurs. Example:\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "ans. Multithreading: Uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory, good for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space, better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "ans. * Provides detailed error tracking\n",
    "* Helps in debugging and maintenance\n",
    "* Allows different logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)\n",
    "* Supports saving logs to files\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "ans. Python manages memory using reference counting and garbage collection to free unused memory automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "ans. * Use try block for risky code.\n",
    "* Use except block to handle exceptions.\n",
    "* Use else block for code that runs if no exceptions occur.\n",
    "* Use finally block for cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "ans. Prevents memory leaks\n",
    "Ensures efficient resource utilization\n",
    "Optimizes program performance\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "ans. try contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "except catches and handles specific exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "ans. Uses reference counting to track object usage.\n",
    "Uses generational garbage collection to remove cyclic references.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "ans. if no exceptions occur inside try. Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",

    "ERROR – Serious problems\n",
    "CRITICAL – Very severe errors\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "ans. os.fork(): Creates a child process in UNIX-based systems.\n",
    "multiprocessing: Portable across platforms and safer for complex process management.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "ans. Prevents memory leaks\n",
    "Ensures data is properly written\n",
    "Releases system resources\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "ans. file.read(): Reads the entire file.\n",
    "file.readline(): Reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the logging module in Python used for? \n",
    "ans. Provides a standardized way to log events and errors in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
